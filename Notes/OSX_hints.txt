# Tor
	To have launchd start tor at login:
    	ln -sfv /usr/local/opt/tor/*.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
	Then to load tor now:
    	launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.tor.plist
    To reload tor after an upgrade:
    	launchctl unload ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.tor.plist
   		launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.tor.plist

Make a backup copy of the application
Open the application folder, then right click the app and choose "Show Package Contents"
Edit Contents/info.plist
Toward the bottom of the file, just before </dict>, add the following lines:
<key>NSHighResolutionCapable</key>
<string>True</string>
Move the app package out of the applications folder. Then move it back in.
The application may now allow a hacked, possibly glitchy retina mode.
